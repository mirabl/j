<p><em>Single Round Match 536 Round 1 - Division II, Level Two</em></p>

<h2>Statement</h2>

<p>Byteasar is playing a tabletop role-playing game with his friends. To determine the effectiveness of their heroes' actions the players use a rather unique set of dice which may have nonequal number of faces. Each die has between 1 and 9 faces, inclusive. If a die has m faces, they contain precisely all the values between 1 and m, inclusive. More precisely, for each k between 1 and m, inclusive, there is one face that shows exactly k pips. When a die is cast, every face has equal probability to come out on top.</p>

<p>Every time all the dice were thrown at once, Byteasar wrote down the numbers of pips visible on each of the topmost faces (in any order). The results of the i-th throw are given in <em>throws</em>[i]; the length of <em>throws</em>[i] is equal to the number of dice and each character of <em>throws</em>[i] denotes the number of pips visible on one of the topmost faces. For example, if <em>throws</em>[3][0]='7', this means that in throw 3 (0-based index) one of the dice showed exactly 7 pips on the top. Please note that the ordering of dice may be different for different throws.</p>

<p>Given the String[] <em>throws</em> containing Byteasar's notes, return the minimum possible total number of faces of all dice.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>Class</em>: <code>RollingDiceDivTwo</code></li>
<li><em>Method</em>: <code>minimumFaces</code></li>
<li><em>Parameters</em>: <code>String[]</code></li>
<li><em>Returns</em>: <code>int</code></li>
<li><em>Method signature</em>: <code>int minimumFaces(String[] rolls)</code></li>
</ul>


<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Please note that a die can have as few as one or two faces.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Constraints</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>rolls</em> will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.</li>
<li><em>rolls</em>[0] will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.</li>
<li>All elements of <em>rolls</em> will contain the same number of characters.</li>
<li>Each character in each element of <em>rolls</em> will be one of '1'-'9'.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p><c>["137", "364", "115", "724"]</c></p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p><c>14</c></p>

<h4>Reason</h4>

<p>In the first throw the numbers of pips on the topmost faces of the dice were 1, 3 and 7; in the second throw they were 3, 6 and 4, in the third they were 1, 1 and 5 and in the fourth roll they were 7, 2 and 4. The players may have used dice with 3, 4 and 7 faces, giving a total of 14 faces. No other possible set of dice has less faces in total.</p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p><c>["1112", "1111", "1211", "1111"]</c></p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p><c>5</c></p>

<h4>Reason</h4>

<p>The players could have used three dice with one face each and one die with two faces.</p>

<h3>Example 3</h3>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p><c>["24412", "56316", "66666", "45625"]</c></p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p><c>30</c></p>

<h4>Reason</h4>

<p>The players could have used five dice with six faces each.</p>

<h3>Example 4</h3>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p><c>["931", "821", "156", "512", "129", "358", "555"]</c></p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p><c>19</c></p>

<h3>Example 5</h3>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p><c>["3", "7", "4", "2", "4"]</c></p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p><c>7</c></p>

<h3>Example 6</h3>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p><c>["281868247265686571829977999522", "611464285871136563343229916655", "716739845311113736768779647392", "779122814312329463718383927626",<br />"571573431548647653632439431183", "547362375338962625957869719518", "539263489892486347713288936885", "417131347396232733384379841536"]</c></p>
