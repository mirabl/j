<p><em>Single Round Match 576 Round 1 - Division I, Level One</em></p>

<h2>Statement</h2>

<p>You might remember the old computer arcade games. Here is one about Manao.</p>

<p>The game level is an NxM grid of equal cells. The bottom of some cells has a platform at which Manao can stand. All the cells in the bottommost row contain a platform, thus covering the whole ground of the level. The rows of the grid are numbered from 1 to N starting from the top and the columns are numbered from 1 to M starting from the left. Exactly one cell contains a coin and Manao needs to obtain it.</p>

<p>Initially, Manao is standing on the ground, i.e., in the bottommost row. He can move between two horizontally adjacent cells if both contain a platform. Also, Manao has a ladder which he can use to climb. He can use the ladder to climb both up and down. If the ladder is L units long, Manao can climb between two cells (i1, j) and (i2, j) if both contain a platform and |i1-i2| &lt;= L. Note that Manao carries the ladder along, so he can use it multiple times. You need to determine the minimum ladder length L which is sufficient to acquire the coin.</p>

<p>Take a look at the following picture. On this level, Manao will manage to get the coin with a ladder of length 2.</p>

<p><img src="images/pic.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>You are given a int[] <em>level</em> containing N elements. The j-th character in the i-th row of <em>level</em> is 'X' if cell (i+1, j+1) contains a platform and '.' otherwise. You are also given ints <em>coinRow</em> and <em>coinColumn</em>. The coin which Manao seeks is located in cell (<em>coinRow</em>, <em>coinColumn</em>) and it is guaranteed that this cell contains a platform.</p>

<p>Return the minimum L such that ladder of length L is enough to get the coin. If Manao can perform the task without using the ladder, return 0.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>Class</em>: <code>ArcadeManao</code></li>
<li><em>Method</em>: <code>shortestLadder</code></li>
<li><em>Parameters</em>: <code>String[], int, int</code></li>
<li><em>Returns</em>: <code>int</code></li>
<li><em>Method signature</em>: <code>int shortestLadder(String[] level, int coinRow, int coinColumn)</code></li>
</ul>


<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Manao is not allowed to fall. The only way in which he may change his vertical coordinate is by using the ladder.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Constraints</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>level</em> will contain N elements, where N is between 1 and 50, inclusive.</li>
<li>Each element of <em>level</em> will be M characters long, where M is between 1 and 50, inclusive.</li>
<li>Each element of <em>level</em> will consist of '.' and 'X' characters only.</li>
<li>The last element of <em>level</em> will be entirely filled with 'X'.</li>
<li><em>coinRow</em> will be between 1 and N, inclusive.</li>
<li><em>coinColumn</em> will be between 1 and M, inclusive.</li>
<li><em>level</em>[<em>coinRow</em> - 1][<em>coinColumn</em> - 1] will be 'X'.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p><c>["XXXX....",<br /> "...X.XXX",<br /> "XXX..X..",<br /> "......X.",<br /> "XXXXXXXX"],<br />2,<br />4</c></p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p><c>2</c></p>

<h4>Reason</h4>

<p>The example from the problem statement.</p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p><c>["XXXX",<br /> "...X",<br /> "XXXX"],<br />1,<br />1</c></p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p><c>1</c></p>

<h4>Reason</h4>

<p>Manao can use the ladder to climb from the ground to cell (2, 4), then to cell (1, 4) and then he can walk right to the coin.</p>

<h3>Example 3</h3>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p><c>["..X..",<br /> ".X.X.",<br /> "X...X",<br /> ".X.X.",<br /> "..X..",<br /> "XXXXX"],<br />1,<br />3</c></p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p><c>4</c></p>

<h4>Reason</h4>

<p>With a ladder of length 4, Manao can first climb to cell (5, 3) and then right to (1, 3).</p>

<h3>Example 4</h3>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p><c>["X"],<br />1,<br />1</c></p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p><c>0</c></p>

<h4>Reason</h4>

<p>Manao begins in the same cell as the coin.</p>

<h3>Example 5</h3>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p><c>["XXXXXXXXXX",<br /> "...X......",<br /> "XXX.......",<br /> "X.....XXXX",<br /> "..XXXXX..X",<br /> ".........X",<br /> ".........X",<br /> "XXXXXXXXXX"],<br />1,<br />1</c></p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p><c>2</c></p>
