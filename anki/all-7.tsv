SD components: load-balancer layer 4 vs. layer 7	4:<br>- look at transport layer: IP address, port<br>- do NAT<br>- often hardware<br><br>7:<br> look at application layer, like URL for HTTP, cookies<br>terminates network traffic, remove TLS<br>called reverse-proxy server
SD: event-sourcing pattern	use append-only store of actions/events
SD: CQRS	command query responsibility separation<br>separate read and write of data
SD DS: SSTable<br>def, internals, read, write	persistent ordered immutable on disk<br>Index and Data blocks<br>Index (in-memory): PK (ex. B-Tree) and offsets in Data<br>Data 64KB block: key-value pairs<br>optimised for reads, written sequentially<br>no in-place changes
