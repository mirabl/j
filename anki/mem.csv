Tree: find lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree (not BST);1. find path to x, to y, find last common element. O(n) 2 traversals. 2. rec: LCA has one node on each side. O(n) 1 traversal.
Misc: websocket;persistent bi-directionnal connnection over TCP, less overhead than HTTP, no need to do new TCP handshake
