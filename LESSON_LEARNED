graph: reduce graph to large steps when possible (ThreeTeleports)
graph: re-use graph structure passed as argument to save time, even if string[]
graph: don't rush into graph algorithm if simpler geometric trick (CirclesCountry)
sorting: sorting repeatedly when only small change? can use heap (BoxesDiv2)
math: coins when values are multiple, simplifies math problem
div: avoid extra storage when possible, temp arrays when original data can be used in place
div: construct optimal solution by looking at solution without constraint then adding them
linkedlist: reverse recursing faster keeping track of the end to make append faster
delete element from linked list: use dummy node
overflow: use - or / instead of + and *
